   cat test/textstream | java -jar bin/huffman.jar

2. Second method you have to enter the text stream on console and then hit cntrl D to end
   
    java -jar bin/huffman.jar 
    hit control D when you are finsihed giving the text stream


Running Test suite
To test, you must specify the text stream using one of the above methods.
To test strings must be specified on command line. There are two ways this can be done.
 1. first argumen is string to encode and second argument is expected encoding
    
     cat test/textstream | java -jar bin/huffman.jar <string to test> <expected encoding of the test string>

 2. Specify a bunch of  test string and expected encoding in a file on separate line. Look at test/testsuite

    cat test/textstream | java -jar bin/huffman.jar test/testsuite
