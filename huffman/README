Instructions to run
The first argument to the program should always be the text stream. If the text stream contain spaces then it should be quoted
1. java -jar bin/huffman.jar "Huffman code test"

2. To test a string for huffman coding based on dictionary created using a stream.
   java -jar bin/huffman.jar "this is stream for huffman code" <input string> <expected code>
    
  e.g  java -jar bin/huffman.jar "abc" a 0
  
  In above expected encoding for a is 0

3. You can also specify bunch of strings to tested in a testsuite file. In that case the second argument of the program should be
   the filename containing test string and expected encoding on each line. See file test/testsuite
  
   java -jar bin/huffman.jar "huffman code" test/testsuite
